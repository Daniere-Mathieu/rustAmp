🎵 RustAmp – Another Rust Audio Player

RustAmp is a work-in-progress command-line audio player written in Rust. The goal of this project is to help me learn the Rust programming language by building something functional and fun. Eventually, RustAmp will support local audio playback, basic playlist features, and a simple terminal interface.

Currently, the project is in its very early stages — no playback functionality is implemented yet. Stay tuned!
✨ Planned Features

Play local audio files

Pause and resume playback

Seek within audio files

Volume control

    Playlist management

🛠️ Requirements

To build and run RustAmp (once it's functional), you'll need:

    Rust (latest stable version)

🚀 Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Daniere-Mathieu/rustAmp.git
cd rustamp

Build the project:

cargo build

Run the project (currently just a placeholder):

    cargo run

    You should see a simple message like RustAmp is alive! for now.

📚 Roadmap

    Setup project structure ✅

    Add audio playback backend

    Implement CLI interface

    Playlist & queue system

    Configuration file support
